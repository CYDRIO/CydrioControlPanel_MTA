# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Did you found a bug?
* ~~**Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in CPanel**, and instead email us to ------.~~ 
  
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/CYDRIO/CydrioControlPanel_MTA/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/CYDRIO/CydrioControlPanel_MTA/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Submitting changes

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should be a brief summary of the commit and a paragraph describing what changed and its impact.

## Coding conventions

* We **ALWAYS** put spaces after list items and method parameters ([1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3]), around operators (x += 1, not x+=1), and around hash arrows.

* This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
